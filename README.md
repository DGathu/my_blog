# üìù Simple Blog App with Next.js, Prisma, and React Query

Welcome to my Simple Blog App! This project demonstrates how to build a basic blog application using Next.js, Prisma as an ORM to interact with a PostgreSQL database, and Tanstack's React Query for performing CRUD operations. Additionally, I've integrated React Hook Form to create user-friendly post forms.

## üöÄ Features

- **Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD)** posts.
- **User-friendly forms** for creating and editing posts using React Hook Form.
- **Efficient data fetching** and caching with Tanstack's React Query.
- **Database interaction** using Prisma with PostgreSQL.
- **Responsive design** for a seamless experience across devices.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: A React framework for building server-rendered applications.
- **Prisma**: An ORM for Node.js and TypeScript that simplifies database interactions.
- **PostgreSQL**: A powerful, open-source relational database.
- **Tanstack React Query**: A library for managing server state and caching.
- **React Hook Form**: A library for building performant and flexible forms.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.

## üîß Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yDGathu/my_blog.git
   cd my_blog
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up your environment variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following:
   ```env
   DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/blogdb"
   ```

4. **Set up the database**:
   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate dev --name init
   ```

5. **Run the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

6. **Open your browser**:
   Visit `http://localhost:3000` to see the app in action.

## üìù Usage

### Creating a New Post

1. Navigate to the "New Post" page.
2. Fill out the form with the post title and content.
3. Click "Submit" to create the post.

3. Confirm the deletion.

## üìä Database Schema

The database schema is defined in the `prisma/schema.prisma` file. The main model is the `Post` model:

```prisma
model Post {
  id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  title     String
  content   String
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt
}
```

## üìö API Routes

The API routes are defined in the `pages/api/posts` directory:

- `GET /api/posts`: Fetch all posts.
- `GET /api/posts/[id]`: Fetch a single post by ID.
- `POST /api/posts`: Create a new post.
- `PATCH /api/posts/[id]`: Update a post by ID.
- `DELETE /api/posts/[id]`: Delete a post by ID.
